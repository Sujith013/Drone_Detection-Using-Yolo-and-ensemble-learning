# Multiple-Objects-Detection-In-Drone-Images-for-Army-Surveillance
Drones are used widely in various fields such as security monitoring, traffic control, party photos etc. There are numerous objects present in every image captured by a drone. The detection of objects present in an image captured by a drone can solve real-world problems.

Drones are used widely in various fields such as security monitoring, traffic control, party photos etc. There are numerous objects present in every image captured by a drone. The detection of objects present in an image captured by a drone can solve real-world problems. It could be effeciently used for the surveillance in the army for detecting small objects at a distance like drones and birds.

We use the ensemble learning approach to combine the power and effeciency of the three models to get better accuracy and reduce the training time.
